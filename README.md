The code in this project is a completed example of my blog "My Internet of Things and MobileFirst Adventure", which you can find at https://dennisschultz.wordpress.com/2015/06/25/my-internet-of-things-and-mobilefirst-adventure-part-1/.

Don't expect to be able to just unzip this and run it.  There are several templated values in the code for things such as URLs and authentication values for Bluemix services.  You will need to follow the blog and create your own Bluemix services first.  You can use the Node-RED json files here by pasting their content into the Import dialog in Node-RED.  You can also probably use the Xcode project as-is once you enter your connection and authentication information in a few spots.
